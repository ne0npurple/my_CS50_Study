CASE1:

Gets all the tv shows which is starred by an actor named Steve Carell.

    basically as we can see in the database structure, stars and writers are put in the same big table named "people", 
    and divided again in another table named "stars" and "writers" where each person is then identified using person_id.

    1. Using query to get the data:

        - first, get the id of specified person search by the name:
            SELECT id FROM people WHERE name="Steve Carell";
        
        - second, gets the show_id where the person_id is == to the one we wanted, this time the person name is Steve Carell:
            SELECT show_id FROM stars WHERE person_id = (SELECT id FROM people WHERE name="Steve Carell");

        - gets the title from table shows where all the movies are starred by Steve Carell:
            SELECT title FROM shows WHERE id IN (SELECT show_id FROM stars WHERE person_id = (SELECT id FROM people WHERE name="Steve Carell"));

    2. Use JOIN to get the data:

        SELECT title FROM people JOIN stars ON people.id=stars.person_id JOIN shows ON stars.show_id=shows.id WHERE name="Steve Carell";

        --> we can add another condition to order the title by adding "order by title"
