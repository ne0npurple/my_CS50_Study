Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 

The smallest simulations (10 simulations) shows that the predictions might not be as accurate compared to a bigger number of simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 

After 1OK simulations, the prediction is good enough
